# Progress

Handoff notes between sessions. Read at the start, update at the end.

## Done

- **Step 1 (setup), 2026-10-16:** repo files (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE GPL-3.0, CHANGELOG, issue and PR templates), `.gitignore`, skeleton in `src/periodicool`, env config, `/health`, SQLite engine, Alembic with an empty baseline migration, 13 tests, ruff config, CI workflow. Tests and lint pass locally on Python 3.14.9. `/health` smoke-tested against a throwaway config dir.

## Next

- Step 2: pull release titles for the dev magazines from Prowlarr category 7010 into `tests/fixtures/`.

## Decisions

- Python pinned to 3.14 (`requires-python = ">=3.14,<3.15"`, CI on 3.14). Docker base image will be `python:3.14-slim` (step 9).
- Dependencies pinned exactly in `pyproject.toml` (latest as of 2026-10-16).
- Package lives in `src/periodicool`. Migrations ship inside the package (`periodicool/migrations`) so the image can run them on startup.
- The app runs `alembic upgrade head` on startup.
- The baseline migration creates no tables. The settings table and domain tables come in step 4, through plan mode, since they are data model changes.
- Default port 8383 (does not clash with the common *arr ports).
- Env vars are prefixed `PERIODICOOL_` for paths and bind settings; `PUID`, `PGID`, `UMASK`, `TZ` keep their usual names.
- Tag-triggered GHCR image workflow comes with the Dockerfile in step 9. CI for now: ruff and pytest on every push.
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT contact points to the maintainer's GitHub profile, not an email address.

## Open questions

- Starlette warns that `httpx` with its TestClient is deprecated in favor of `httpx2`. Harmless for now; swapping the dev dependency needs approval.
